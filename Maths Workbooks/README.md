# About

My fifth grade teacher used to have us do 10x10 grids of maths problems to see who could complete them the fastest. They helped me. I made these to tutor some kids a while ago. The calculations are reloaded when the document is opened or manually recalculated with `F9`.

These documents were last edited with LibreOffice v24.
